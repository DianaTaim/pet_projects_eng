       "       'As a lifelong athlete and endurance junkie, Iâ€™ve always been fascinated with the idea of using food to fuel the body to optimize performance. Like many others, I initially fell into the trap of convenient options like goos, gels, and bars that promised to deliver amazing results. However, it didnâ€™t take long before my body quickly reminded me that using real food as a fuel source was the way to go. \\n\\nIt was simple.  If I wanted to get the best out of my bodyâ€™s performance for an event, creating a plan around my food was vital.  And since all of our bodies are different, that also meant learning what was best for my individual body  #baconforthewin!\\n\\nWhile the idea of using â€œfood as fuelâ€\\x9d for performance was obvious, the idea of using â€œfood as medicineâ€\\x9d had never crossed my mind.  After all, I had always considered myself to be healthy.  And then I learned about gut health and the Betr Health program, and my mind was completely blown!  \\n\\nThe reality is that most of us have inflammation wreaking havoc in our bodies, and we arenâ€™t even aware of it.  Inflammation is the root cause of most illnesses: including things like chronic disease, auto-immune issues, obesity, allergies, anxiety & depression, skin conditions, digestive problems, etc., and itâ€™s even affecting our mood, sleep, and energy levels.  \\n\\nDid you know that you could be eating healthy food, but yet because your body is sensitive to it, itâ€™s causing inflammation? Do you realize that if you try to exercise while you have inflammation in your body, it makes other problems even worse?  Did you know that when you use â€œfood as medicine,â€\\x9d to heal your gut, you can reverse almost all of those issues, shed weight effortlessly, and do it quickly? I didnâ€™t. \\n\\nBetr Health is an incredible personalized program that not only gives you results within days but it empowers and educates you on how to use â€œfood as medicineâ€\\x9d to live a healthy, happy, and energized life.

I come from a family of teachers and entrepreneurs, so itâ€™s not surprising that I make my living by problem solving and guiding others on their path. My background is in biological systems, where I studied environmental science and epidemiology. When I was younger, I pursued a brief career in research, but Iâ€™m best known for helping people make sense of their bodies. As a trainer and writer I established a reputation for distilling the breadth and depth of physical performance for clients in over 2 dozen countries around the world. However, despite making a name for myself with â€œbody stuffâ€\\x9d Iâ€™m most at home with the eminent minds in psychotherapy and philosophy. \\n\\nYou see, as a kid I was â€œtoo intelligentâ€\\x9d and â€œtoo sensitiveâ€\\x9d to ever really feel at ease. It took me a long time to make sense of what I was thinking and feeling - and longer still to figure out how to use those gifts effectively. As you can imagine: itâ€™s pretty challenging to know what to put on a business card!\\n\\nWhat I can tell you is that Iâ€™m at my best when Iâ€™m using movement, awareness, and thoughtful dialogue to help my clients leverage the bodyâ€™s wisdom in service of â€œthe big workâ€\\x9d of their lives. Some examples include:\\n\\n* A data scientist who struggled with chronic pain and digestive issues before leaving Silicon Valley to pursue a new career in nuclear activism and restorative agriculture.\\n\\n* An experimental test pilot who recovered from the damage of two plane crashes and created a â€œhealth villageâ€\\x9d in the mountains of Switzerland.\\n\\n* A documentary filmmaker who grappled with ongoing stress and self-doubt who went on to introduce a niche form of yoga to an entire continent.\\n\\nThe work I do is guided by a few themes:\\n\\n* You do not have a body; you are a body. The body is where your mind meets the world around you. Itâ€™s the fertile soil of transformation, your entire life history in the flesh. When you change the way you walk, talk, sit, and stand, you change your world. \\n\\n* Embrace the patience of bones and possibility of synapses. Meaningful growth comes when we orient toward a long term vision and hold space for everyday synchronicities along the way.\\n\\n* Thereâ€™s magic in not-knowing. The real work begins with the pivotal question: what do you do when you donâ€™t know what to do?\\n\\nFor me thatâ€™s what itâ€™s all about. \\n\\nIf this clicks, we should have a conversation.',\n",
